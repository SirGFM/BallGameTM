# Reducing PDF size

The PDF manual should be generated by opening the manual in a browser
and printing it. One way to do it, if the path to the images isn't resolved
properly, is to launch a web server:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Then, simply use your browser of choice to print it as a PDF.
However, the generated PDF will most likely be **very** large.
It's size may be reduced by using ghostscript:

```sh
sudo apt install ghostscript
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=ballgametm.pdf manual.pdf
```
